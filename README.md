# Fueling Automation using OMS (Ordering Management System)

This project was basically created for a truck transportation company to manage and operate the fueling of all their trucks on their partnered gas stations efficiently. It cuts down the paperwork and records and loose bill system by storing everything on the cloud with easy access through authorised users.

I used HTML5, CSS, JS and Bootstrap to design the frontend of this website and used PHP to operate and functionalise everything with MySQL to manage the database needs.
It generates invoices in form of pdfs using the TCPDF library and phpMailer to communicate between the entities.
